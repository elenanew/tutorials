You can use:



***Text*** (including bold, italic, etc)

  **Example:** 
It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* and ***bold italic*** with Markdown.

You can use ~~strikethrough~~ font

***Headers***

  **Example:** 
## This is an h2 header 
###### This is an h6 header

***Lists***

  **Example:** 
  
Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two 
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

You can create nested lists: 

* item1
    * one_one
    * two

***Blockquotes***

  **Example:** 
In the words of Abraham Lincoln:
> Pardon my French

***Links***

  **Example:** 
[Primer] [id]:
[id]: http://tut.by

<http://tut.by>

<address@example.com>

***There are three different types of messages: Note, Caution and Warning.***

>### Warning
>jhkjhkjhkjhkj
>>### Warning
>>>### Warning
>>>>### Warning
>>>>This is a Warning. 

&nbsp;

>### Caution
>iikjhiojhioji
>>### Caution
>>This is a Caution. 

&nbsp;

>### Testyy
>This is a note. 

&nbsp;

  **Example:** 
  
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and ~~tags~~ supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
